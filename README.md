# C-Static-Analyzer-
Parser, Lines of code, Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Complexity, Maintainability Index

You can only analyze C files here
C++ files can be analyzed but the results are not guaranted.
Due to the restriction from my supervisor I avoided using regular expression
You have to put the name of the files as the argument of the main function to analyze a file
